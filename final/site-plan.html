        At first dungeons and Dragons may not seem like it is meant for everybody. Some people may see it as a bunch of people coming together to hallucinate as a group, and others may see it as people pulling stories out of nowhere and everyone clapping, saying that it was such a good idea. Whatever someone may view dungeons and Dragons as, if you are able to show a person dungeons and Dragons in a light that they might understand a little better, it would be able to possibly open them up to participating in a game. I would like to be able to help people understand how the game of dungeons and Dragons is played. This ranges from character creation and keeping track of your character, to how the mechanics of the game work such as dice and stats. I would like to create a place where someone can keep track of all these difficult to comprehend things and give them the opportunity to be able to have that information at their fingertips wherever they may be. <br>

        Dice rolls and statistic modifiers are something that can be pretty difficult to keep track of. Knowing which dice to roll and how many of them to roll can be confusing especially to a new player. Being able to have a program that helps you in this situation would benefit everyone who is not quite completely sure of how their character works. Being able to keep track of whether or not advantage or disadvantages is in effect, as well as how modifiers are used without having to do so buy one's self can make learning the game a lot easier. Another problem that a new player may have is that they don't have dice of their own. Being able to have a place where you cannot only combine their character and their stats with a set of dice that they don't have to pay for would allow a player to be able to not have to rely on the others in the group as well as give them a chance to slowly learn the mechanics of the game. <br>      </p>
        
        Teaching someone who has never played dungeons and Dragons before how to create a character can be an undertaking. Being able to collect all of the advice from experienced players into one place, and having that place available to people who don't have much experience at all would allow all sorts of people with different personalities to see how others are able to create such lifelike characters. Everyone will have their own approach to creating a character. Certain people will take the min Max route where they make an incredibly strong character who can't do anything else. others will take the RP route where they create characters who are fun to play outside of combat, who may not end up being very strong once a fight starts. Everyone has their own approach, so having many different starting points for people to go from will allow for more people to enjoy the game. Character creation and storage is an interesting concept because it starts with needing an idea for a character and their personality. It is not always as simple as choosing a class, race, and alignment. You need to be able to feel your character's emotions and understand how they would react in certain situations. A player should be able to distinguish their own emotions from their characters emotions. <br>
