    <h2>Joshua Ellis</h2>
    <h2>Software Engineering</h2>
    <h2></h2>
    <p>I am married (For about 2 years). I work at Game Pulse in town. I
        recently started playing Dungeons and Dragons, and one of my other 
        hobbies is online gaming. </p>
    <p>I think that an advantage to learning about Web design Careers 
        gives me the options and variety in my career portfolio. I have
        been a member of the church for my entire life. </p>
    <p>The thing that inspired me to become a software engineer was because
        I wanted to learn how Video Games worked. I was amazed by how everythign
        worked in the background to create what we all see. </p>
